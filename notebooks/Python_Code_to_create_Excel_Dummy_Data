## 🛠️ Synthetic Business Data Generator

I built a Python script that generates realistic, interconnected business datasets for analytics, dashboarding, and data science practice. It creates CSVs for customers, products, sales reps, marketing campaigns, sales transactions, web analytics, and A/B test results—all with reproducible fake data.

**Features:**
- 7 business-relevant tables (customers, products, sales, etc.)
- Realistic relationships and metrics
- Reproducible results (seeded randomness)
- Great for SQL, BI, and data science demos
