## Data Preparation & Import

### Initial Data Sources
- **Primary Data**: Sales data in CSV format
- **Supporting Data**: Excel file with additional tables
- **Database**: Microsoft SQL Server (local instance)

### Data Import Process
1. **Attempted SQL Server Connection**
   - Tried connecting to the local Microsoft SQL Server instance
   - **Issue Encountered**: Tableau Online cannot connect to local SQL Server instances
   - **Error**: "A connection could not be made because the target machine actively refused it"
   
2. **Solution: Excel File Import**
   - Switched to an Excel file containing the same data
   - Successfully imported all the sheets with accurate data:
     - `sales` (main transaction data)
     - `sales_reps` (sales representative information)
     - `products` (product catalog)
     - `campaigns` (campaign details) and 3 other tables.

---

## Data Source Connection

### Connection Steps
1. **Tableau Online Access**
   - Logged into the Tableau Online platform
   - Selected "Connect to Data" option

2. **File Upload**
   - Uploaded Excel file containing all data sheets
   - Verified successful data import
   - Confirmed all sheets were accessible in the Data pane

3. **Data Preview**
   - Reviewed data structure for each sheet
   - Verified field types and data quality
   - Identified key fields for relationships

---

## Data Relationships Setup

### Relationship Configuration
Created relationships between multiple data tables to enable comprehensive analysis:

1. **Sales ↔ Sales_Reps Relationship**
   - **Connection Field**: `Sales Rep Id`
   - **Purpose**: Link sales transactions to representative names
   - **Result**: Enabled name display instead of ID numbers

2. **Sales ↔ Products Relationship**
   - **Connection Field**: `Product Id`
   - **Purpose**: Link sales to product information
   - **Result**: Enabled product name filtering instead of ID codes

3. **Sales ↔ Campaigns Relationship**
   - **Connection Field**: `Campaign Id`
   - **Purpose**: Connect sales to marketing campaigns
   - **Result**: Enabled campaign performance analysis

### Data Model Benefits
- **Normalized Data Structure**: Avoided data duplication
- **User-Friendly Display**: Names instead of ID codes
- **Flexible Analysis**: Multiple analysis dimensions available
---

## Sales Representative Analysis

### Chart Development Process
1. **Initial Setup**
   - **Chart Type**: Horizontal bar chart
   - **X-Axis**: Total (revenue)
   - **Y-Axis**: Sales Rep Id (initially)

2. **Data Enhancement**
   - **Problem**: The Chart showed ID numbers instead of names
   - **Solution**: Utilized sales_reps relationship
   - **Implementation**: Replaced Sales Rep ID with Sales Rep Name
   - **Result**: User-friendly chart with actual representative names

3. **Chart Optimization**
   - **Sorting**: Applied descending sort by revenue
   - **Labels**: Added revenue amounts directly on bars
   - **Formatting**: Improved readability and professional appearance

## Campaign Performance Analysis

1. **Chart Creation**
   - **Visualization Type**: Horizontal bar chart
   - **X-Axis**: Total (revenue)
   - **Y-Axis**: Campaign Name (using relationship to display names instead of IDs)
   - **Title**: "Campaign Effectiveness Analysis"

2. **Data Enhancement Process**
   - **Initial Setup**: Campaign Id on Y-axis showing only numbers
   - **Improvement**: Utilized campaign relationship to display full campaign names
   - **Result**: User-friendly chart with descriptive campaign names instead of IDs
   - **Sorting**: Applied descending sort by revenue for clear performance ranking

3. **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**
   - **Color Encoding**: Product categories are shown through different colors within each bar
   - **Benefit**: Reveals which products drive revenue within each campaign
   - **Business Value**: Shows both campaign performance AND product mix effectiveness
   - **Executive Insight**: Enables understanding of campaign-product synergies interactively

## KPI Development

### KPI Strategy
Developed executive-level Key Performance Indicators to provide quick business insights:

### KPI Sheet Creation Process
Created 4 separate sheets for individual KPIs:

1. **Total Revenue KPI**
   - **Calculation**: SUM(Total)
   - **Display**: Large, prominent number
   - **Purpose**: Overall business performance indicator

2. **Average Deal Size KPI**
   - **Calculation**: AVG(Total)
   - **Result**: $15,429.20
   - **Purpose**: Deal quality and pricing insights

3. **Total Orders KPI**
   - **Calculation**: COUNT(Sale Id)
   - **Result**: 1,200 transactions
   - **Purpose**: Volume and activity metrics

4. **Active Sales Reps KPI**
   - **Calculation**: COUNTD(Sales Rep Name)
   - **Result**: 10 unique representatives
   - **Purpose**: Team size and resource allocation

### KPI Technical Implementation
1. **Sheet Structure**
   - **Mark Type**: Text
   - **Field Placement**: Total in Rows, then moved to Label
   - **Formatting**: Large font, professional appearance

2. **Dashboard Integration**
   - **Layout**: Horizontal strip at top of dashboard
   - **Sizing**: Uniform dimensions for professional appearance
   - **Positioning**: Equal spacing between KPI cards

## Interactive Filters Implementation

### Filter Development Process
1. **Basic Filter Setup**
   - **Date Filter**: Range selector for time period analysis
   - **Product Name Filter**: Multi-select dropdown (using product names, not IDs)
   - **Quantity Filter**: Range slider for transaction size filtering

2. **Filter Display Configuration**
   - **Method**: Right-click on filters → "Show Filter"
   - **Positioning**: Right side panel for easy access
   - **User Experience**: Intuitive, business-user friendly

### Filter Synchronization Challenges
1. **Initial Problem**
   - **Issue**: KPI cards not responding to dashboard filters
   - **Symptom**: Main chart filtered correctly, KPIs remained static
   - **Root Cause**: KPI sheets lacked proper filter connections

2. **Resolution Process**
   - **Step 1**: Added Date and Product Name filters to each KPI sheet individually
   - **Step 2**: Ensured filters were in the Filters shelf (not displayed)
   - **Step 3**: Tested filter responsiveness on individual sheets

3. **Dashboard Synchronization Issues**
   - **Problem**: Duplicate filters appeared (separate for chart and KPIs)
   - **Symptom**: Two sets of identical filters on the dashboard
   - **Solution**: Removed duplicate filters, configured a single filter set to control all elements

4. **Final Filter Configuration**
   - **Method**: "Apply to Worksheets" → "All worksheets using this data source"
   - **Result**: Single filter set controls entire dashboard
   - **Verification**: All elements (chart and KPIs) respond to filter changes
